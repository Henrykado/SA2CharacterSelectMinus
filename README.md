# SA2CharacterSelectPlus
This sonic adventure 2 mod adds in 4 new buttons in the character select menu for the chao garden, to easily access the 4 alternative characters for the chao garden - 7th July 2018

Planned: editing the mission select menu to choose character before starting level, and making it possible to choose between all 14 characters (maybe 16, if i get super sonic and super shadow working)
