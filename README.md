# SA2CharacterSelectPlus
This sonic adventure 2 mod adds in 4 new buttons in the character select menu for the chao garden, and a new menu for every stage to select 1 of 14 characters!

this mod uses Mainmemories SA2CharSelect mod code to fix loads of errors - https://github.com/MainMemory/SA2CharSel


big thanks to Exant and Mainmemory, who helped me out with making this mod
