# SA2CharacterSelectMinus
this sonic adventure 2 mod/fork aims to make Character Select PLUS more vanilla-like, by only making you able to choose characters of the same play style as the default character of each level (so only Mech characters for Prison Lane)

it needs to be above the original CSP on the mod loader for it to work
(also sorry if the code is kinda messy, this was my first time coding in cpp) 

this mod uses Mainmemory's SA2CharSelect mod code to fix loads of errors - https://github.com/MainMemory/SA2CharSel


shoutout to Justin, Exant and Mainmemory, who made the original mod
